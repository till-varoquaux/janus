====Javascript optimisation passes====

This directory contains all the javascript optimisation passes. This
passes are all javascript source to source transformations. They
should not change the semantic of a program. In all these passes
variables names are assumed to have a unique name and to be declared
only once. One of these files ([[ScopeInfo.ml.html|ScopeInfo]]) is not
really an optimisation pass, it is used to collect information. It
reccurses over subtrees and is therefor defined like a
pass. Interesting passes include:

-[[DeadCode.ml.html|Deadcode elimination]]: A pretty na√Øve dead code
 elimination, it removes code directly after return statements and
 continue statements in loops.

-[[TailRec.ml.html|Tail reccursion elimination]]: Tail reccursive
 functions are transformed to loops.
